==================
Command line tools
==================

Microprobe is a python package providing an API to generate microbenchmarks. 
The best interface to get all the flexibility is to write down your own
python scripts, as explained in the :doc:`tutorial` section.
This allows the control of the entire microbenchmark generation process. 

However, in some scenarios it is desirable to provide command line tools
and text-based input definition files 
--less flexible and tailored for particular goals-- to avoid the need to 
understand Microprobe internals or learn Python. Check the following
