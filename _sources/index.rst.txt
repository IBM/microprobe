===================================
Welcome to Microprobe Documentation
===================================

Microprobe is a **productive** microbenchmark generation framework that an user 
can **adapt** towards exercising a complex multi-core, multi-threaded computing
system in a variety of redundant ways for answering a range of questions 
related to energy and performance. 

The growth in complexity of microprocessor systems today --composed of 
multi-core, multi-threaded processors with multi-level cache hierarchies and 
giga-bytes of memory--, hardens the pre-silicon system modeling and the 
post-silicon system characterizations. We believe that microbenchmarks, 
generated with particular objectives in mind, hold the key to obtaining 
accurate characterizations of microprocessor systems. Specially crafted 
microbenchmarks may be run on simulators (pre-silicon stage) or real machines 
(post-silicon stage) to help understand, diagnose and fix deficiencies 
systematically. However, manual generation of such "stress-marks" is tedious, 
and requires intimate knowledge of the underlying microarchitecture pipeline 
semantics. Automated microbenchmark generation is therefore crucial in this 
regard. Microprobe is developed to fulfill that need.
