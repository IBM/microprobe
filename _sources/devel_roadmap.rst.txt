====================
Development road-map
====================

Since Microprobe is mainly a research-driven framework, our main focus is 
to provide support to the IBM product teams that use the framework, adding 
features and implementing bug fixes on demand.

Besides that, the current development focus is on improving the code-quality 
and the documentation towards a stable public release of the framework so 
that other user communities can leverage it.
